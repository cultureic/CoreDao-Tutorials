# Decentralized Application Tutorials

Welcome to the repository containing tutorials for building decentralized applications (dApps) using various technologies. This repository includes three distinct dApp tutorials, each in its own directory. Each tutorial showcases different aspects of dApp development and includes a `deployed.json` file with the contract addresses deployed on the Core Testnet.

## Repository Structure


/dapp-01
/dapp-02
/dapp-03


### 1. `dapp-01`: Simple Storage dApp Tutorial
* **Description**: This tutorial demonstrates how to build a simple storage dApp using CoreDAO EVM to store data in a BTC smart contract using [technologies used].
* **Folder**: `dapp-01`
* **Files**: Includes the smart contract, deployment scripts, and frontend setup.
* **Deployed Contracts**: The `deployed.json` file in this folder contains the addresses of the deployed contracts on the Core Testnet.

### 2. `dapp-02`: Simple Staking dApp Tutorial
* **Description**: In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a dApp where we deploy several contracts and a factory for ERC20 tokens standard using CoreDAO EVM on Bitcoin smart contracts with [technologies used].
* **Folder**: `dapp-02`
* **Files**: Contains the smart contracts, deployment scripts, and frontend code.
* **Deployed Contracts**: The `deployed.json` file in this folder provides the contract addresses deployed on the Core Testnet.

### 3. `dapp-03`: Guestbook dApp
* **Description**: This tutorial guides you through creating a decentralized guestbook application using Hardhat, Solidity, and React. It includes instructions for developing and deploying the smart contract, as well as setting up the React frontend.
* **Folder**: `dapp-03`
* **Files**: Includes smart contract code, deployment scripts, and React frontend setup.
* **Deployed Contracts**: The `deployed.json` file in this folder contains the addresses of the deployed contracts on the Core Testnet.

## How to Use the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cultureic/CoreDao-Tutorials
   cd CoreDao-Tutorials


### Navigate to a Tutorial Folder
Each tutorial is located in its respective folder (`dapp-01`, `dapp-02`, `dapp-03`). Navigate to the desired tutorial to view or modify its code.

### Check Deployed Contracts
Within each tutorial folder, you will find a `deployed.json` file. This file contains the addresses of the deployed smart contracts on the Core Testnet. Use these addresses to interact with the contracts or verify their deployment.

### Follow the Tutorial
Each folder includes documentation or code files relevant to its tutorial. Follow the instructions provided in each tutorial to build and deploy the dApp.
